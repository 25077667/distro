Overview and motivation
-----------------------

The :mod:`ld` (linux distribution) package provides information about the
Linux distribution it runs on, such as a reliable machine-readable ID, or
version information.

It is a renewed alternative implementation for Python's original
:py:func:`platform.linux_distribution` function, but it also provides much more
functionality.
An alternative implementation became necessary because Python 3.5 deprecated
this function, and Python 3.7 is expected to remove it altogether.
Its predecessor function :py:func:`platform.dist` was already deprecated since
Python 2.6 and is also expected to be removed in Python 3.7.
Still, there are many cases in which access to that information is needed.
See `Python issue 1322 <https://bugs.python.org/issue1322>`_ for more
information.

Data sources
------------

The :mod:`ld` package implements a robust and inclusive way of retrieving the
information about a Linux distribution based on new standards and old methods,
namely from these data sources (from high to low precedence):

* The os-release file, if present.
  See `Format of the os-release file`_ for details.

* The output of the lsb_release command, if available.
  See `Format of the lsb_release command output`_ for details.

* The distro release file(s), if present.
  See `Format of the distro release file`_ for details.

Access to the information
-------------------------

The distribution information is available as single information items through
specific accessor functions (e.g. :func:`ld.id`).

It is also possible to get the machine-readable part of the information in a
more aggregated way from :func:`ld.info`.

For compatibility, there is a :func:`ld.linux_distribution` function with an
interface that is compatible the original
:py:func:`platform.linux_distribution` function, supporting a subset of its
parameters.
The data it returns may not exactly be the same, because the :mod:`ld`
package uses more data sources, and that may lead to different data if the
Linux distribution is not consistent across multiple data sources it provides
(there are indeed such distributions ...).
Another reason for differences is the fact that the :mod:`ld` package
normalizes the distribution ID string to a reliable machine-readable value for
a number of popular Linux distributions.

The precedence of the data sources listed above is in the listed order (top to
bottom).
The precedence is applied for each information item separately. Therefore, it
is possible that not all information items provided by this package come from
the same data source. For example, on a distribution that has an lsb_release
command that returns the 'Distributor ID' field but not the 'Codename' field,
and that has a distro release file that specifies a codename inside, the
distro ID will come from the lsb_release command (because it has higher
precedence), and the codename will come from the distro release file (because
it is not provided by the lsb_release command).

For distributions that provide multiple inconsistent data sources, it is
possible to get all information items consistently from a particular data
source by using the :func:`ld.os_release_info`, :func:`ld.lsb_release_info`,
and :func:`ld.distro_release_info` functions. These functions also provide
information items that are not provided by the specific accessor functions
for single information items. For example, the os-release file of RHEL 7
contains the following:

    REDHAT_BUGZILLA_PRODUCT="Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7"

The value for this attribute can be retrieved with:

    ld.get_os_release_attr('redhat_bugzilla_product')

It is also possible to retrieve single information items from a particular data
source, by using the :func:`ld.get_os_release_attr`,
:func:`ld.get_lsb_release_attr`, and :func:`ld.get_distro_release_attr`
functions.

Format of the os-release file
-----------------------------

The os-release file is expected to be encoded in UTF-8.

It is parsed using the standard python :py:mod:`shlex` package, which treats it
like a shell script.

The attribute names found in the file are translated to lower case and then
become the keys of the information items from the os-release file data source.
These keys can be used to retrieve single items with the
:func:`ld.get_os_release_attr` function, and they are also used as keys in the
dictionary returned by :func:`ld.os_release_info`.

The attribute values found in the file are processed using shell rules (e.g.
for whitespace, escaping, and quoting) before they become the values of the
information items from the os-release file data source.

If the attribute "VERSION" is found in the file, the distro codename is
extracted from its value if it can be found there. If a codename is found, it
becomes an additional information item with key "codename".

See the `os-release man page
<http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/os-release.html>`_
for a list of possible attributes in the file.

**Example:**

This os-release file content:

::

    NAME='Ubuntu'
    VERSION="14.04.3 LTS, Trusty Tahr"
    ID=ubuntu
    ID_LIKE=debian
    PRETTY_NAME="Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS"
    VERSION_ID="14.04"
    HOME_URL="http://www.ubuntu.com/"
    SUPPORT_URL="http://help.ubuntu.com/"
    BUG_REPORT_URL="http://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/"

results in the following information items:

=================  ======================
Key                Value
=================  ======================
name               "Ubuntu"
version            "14.04.3 LTS, Trusty Tahr"
id                 "ubuntu"
id_like            "debian"
pretty_name        "Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS"
version_id         "14.04"
home_url           "http://www.ubuntu.com/"
support_url        "http://help.ubuntu.com/"
bug_report_url     "http://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/"
=================  ======================

Format of the lsb_release command output
----------------------------------------

The command output is expected to be encoded in UTF-8.

Only lines in the command output with the following format will be used:

    ``<attr-name>: <attr-value>``

Where:

* ``<attr-name>`` is the name of the attribute, and
* ``<attr-value>`` is the attribute value.

The attribute names are stripped from surrounding blanks, any remaining blanks
are translated to underscores, they are translated to lower case, and then
become the keys of the information items from the lsb_release command output
data source.

The attribute values are stripped from surrounding blanks, and then become the
values of the information items from the lsb_release command output data
source.

See the `lsb_release man page
<http://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/LSB_5.0.0/LSB-Core-generic/
LSB-Core-generic/lsbrelease.html>`_
for a description of standard attributes returned by the lsb_release command.

**Example:**

This lsb_release command output:

::

    No LSB modules are available.
    Distributor ID: Ubuntu
    Description:    Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS
    Release:        14.04
    Codename:       trusty

results in the following information items:

=================  ======================
Key                Value
=================  ======================
distributor_id     "Ubuntu"
description        "Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS"
release            "14.04"
codename           "trusty"
=================  ======================

Format of the distro release file
---------------------------------

The distro release file is expected to be encoded in UTF-8.

Only its first line is used, and it must have the following format:

    ``<name> [[[release] <version_id>] (<codename>)]``

Where:

* square brackets indicate optionality,
* ``<name>`` is the distro name,
* ``<version_id>`` is the distro version, and
* ``<codename>`` is the distro codename.

The following information items can be found in a distro release file
(shown with their keys and data types):

* ``id`` (string):  Distro ID, taken from the first part of the file name
  before the hyphen (``-``) or underscore (``_``).

  Note that the distro ID is not normalized or translated to lower case at this
  point; this happens only for the result of the :func:`ld.id` function.

* ``name`` (string):  Distro name, as found in the first line of the file.

* ``version_id`` (string):  Distro version, as found in the first line of the
  file. If not found, this information item will not exist.

* ``codename`` (string):  Distro codename, as found in the first line of the
  file. If not found, this information item will not exist.

  Note that the string in the codename field is not always really a
  codename. For example, in openSUSE, it contains ``x86_64``.

**Examples:**

1.  The following distro release file ``/etc/centos-release``:

    ::

        CentOS Linux release 7.1.1503 (Core)

    results in the following information items:

    =================  ======================
    Key                Value
    =================  ======================
    id                 "centos"
    name               "CentOS Linux"
    version_id         "7.1.1503"
    codename           "Core"
    =================  ======================

2.  The following distro release file ``/etc/oracle-release``:

    ::

        Oracle Linux Server release 7.1

    results in the following information items:

    =================  ======================
    Key                Value
    =================  ======================
    id                 "oracle"
    name               "Oracle Linux Server"
    version_id         "7.1"
    =================  ======================

3.  The following distro release file ``/etc/SuSE-release``:

    ::

        openSUSE 42.1 (x86_64)

    results in the following information items:

    =================  ======================
    Key                Value
    =================  ======================
    id                 "SuSE"
    name               "openSUSE"
    version_id         "42.1"
    codename           "x86_64"
    =================  ======================

        Parameters:

        * ``include_lsb`` (bool): Controls whether the output of the

          See `Format of the os-release file`_ for details.

          An empty string (the default) will cause ``/etc/os-release`` to be

          file that is to be used as a data source.

          See `Format of the distro release file`_ for details.

          An empty string (the default) will cause the first match to be used

          The algorithm to sort the files alphabetically is far from perfect,
          but the distro release file has the least priority as a data source,
          and it is expected that Linux distributions provide one of the other
          data sources.

          If the specified distro release file does not exist, or if no default

        * blanks (which should not be there anyway) are translated to

          even across incompatible changes in the Linux distributions. A common
          case for such a change is the addition of an os-release file, or the
          addition of the lsb_release command, with ID values that differ from
