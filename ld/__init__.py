        * `scientific` - Scientific Linux

        * `xenserver` - XenServer

        Note that the distro ID as provided by the `*_release_info()` and
        `get_*_release_attr()` methods is not reliable, these methods provide
        the values as obtained from the respective sources.

        Details:

        First, the ID is obtained from the following sources, in the specified
        order. The first available and non-empty value is used:

        * the value of the "ID" attribute of the `os-release` file,
        * the value of the "Distribution ID" attribute returned by the
          `lsb_release` command,
        * the first part of the file name of the distro release file,
        * the empty string.

        The so determined ID value then passes the following transformations,
        before it is returned by this method:

        * it is translated to lower case,
        * blanks (which should not be there anyway) are translated to
          underscores,
        * a normalization of the ID is performed, based upon translation
          tables in the `constants` module. The purpose of this normalization
          is to ensure that the ID is as reliable as possible, even across
          incompatible changes in the linux distributions. A common case for
          such a change is the addition of an `os-release` file or the addition
          of the `lsb_release` command, with ID values that differ from what
          was previously determined from the distro release file name.
